## Business Understanding 

**Loan Default:** 
Loan default occurs when a borrower fails to meet their contractual obligation of repaying a loan according to the agreed-upon terms. In the world of financial lending, the management of loan defaults is a critical concern for banks and lending institutions. Understanding the dynamics of loan defaults is essential to assess and mitigate risks in the lending business.

Banks and lenders play a crucial role in this ecosystem by providing loans to borrowers, charging interest rates, and generating revenue from interest payments.
